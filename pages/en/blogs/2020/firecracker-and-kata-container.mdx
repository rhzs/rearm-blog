This is the first Rearm blog that I did. I hope I can satisfy the reader who read this. It's been great pleasure working with Google Kubernetes Engine for the past year. 
I know that it is going to be upside and down. Few days ago I have discovered something interesting that I want to share with you. It is about Micro VM.
A Micro VM has been around for years. Under the promise of light weight and faster start up than the original VM. It tempted me to try out the Micro VM. 

Before we begin, we need to have the following:
1. GCP Account
2. Docker


## Creating a VM with Nested KVM Ability
Our end goal is to create a Micro VM. To achieve this, we can create VM in our GCP. 
In GCP, you can create a Virtual Machine (VM) with selected OS, CPU, Memory, and disk.
We need a special config in order our VM can create another VM inside. We call it a Nested VM, because it has a VM inside a VM.
Before VM creation, we need GCP CLI to enable the Nested VM by enabling the VMX functionality. 

```s
$ gcloud compute images create ub18-nested-kvm --source-disk disk-ub18 --licenses "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/vm-options/global/licenses/enable-vmx" --source-disk-zone asia-southeast1-a
```

Now, create the instance:

```s
$ gcloud compute instances create kata-firecracker-vm --zone us-east1-b --image ub18-nested-kvm
```

To check, you can go to terminal via SSH. 

```s
$ gcloud beta compute ssh kata-firecracker-v
```

A key-pair will be made and uploaded to VM that you created. In terminal, you will see `ubuntu@kata-firecracker-vm:~$`
To see if VMX is available for your VM, you can do:

```s
$ grep -cw vmx /proc/cpuinfo
1
```

<b>Congratulations!</b>

You have successfully created VM with VMX available in Google Compute Engine. 

## Enable KVM in GCE

Still on the terminal, you need to download `qemu-kvm` to enable the KVM. 

```s
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm -y
$ sudo setfacl -m u:${USER}:rw /dev/kvm
$ [ -r /dev/kvm ] && [ -w /dev/kvm ] && echo "OK" || echo "FAIL"
OK
```

## Firecracker Installation and Configuration

To get started, Firecracker binary is needed to be in the VM server. 

```s
# Download Firecracker
$ curl -fsSL -o ./firecracker https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases/download/v0.21.1/firecracker-v0.21.1-x86_64
# Change the permission to become executable
$ chmod +x ./firecracker
# Download hello-vmlinux.bin to test Firecracker
$ curl -fsSL -o ./hello-vmlinux.bin https://s3.amazonaws.com/spec.ccfc.min/img/hello/kernel/hello-vmlinux.bin
# Download hello-rootfs.ext4 to test Firecracker
$ curl -fsSL -o ./hello-rootfs.ext4 https://s3.amazonaws.com/spec.ccfc.min/img/hello/fsfiles/hello-rootfs.ext4
```

See Firecracker docs for further info https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md

Try to execute Firecracker binary file

```s
$ rm -f /tmp/firecracker.sock && ./firecracker --api-sock /tmp/firecracker.sock
```

> You should see nothing after running above command

Now, open new terminal and keep current terminal opened. In new terminal, boot Firecracker from `hello-vmlinux.bin` that we downloaded before. 

```s
$ curl --unix-socket /tmp/firecracker.sock -i \
  -X PUT 'http://localhost/boot-source' -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"kernel_image_path":"./hello-vmlinux.bin","boot_args":"console=ttyS0 reboot=k panic=1 pci=off"}'
HTTP/1.1 204
Server: Firecracker API
Connection: keep-alive
```

Create Firecracker rootfs from `hello-rootfs.ext4` 

```s
$ curl --unix-socket /tmp/firecracker.sock -i \
  -X PUT 'http://localhost/drives/rootfs' -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"drive_id":"rootfs","path_on_host":"./hello-rootfs.ext4","is_root_device":true,"is_read_only":false}'
HTTP/1.1 204
Server: Firecracker API
Connection: keep-alive
```

Start Firecracker instance

```s
$ curl --unix-socket /tmp/firecracker.sock -i \
  -X PUT 'http://localhost/actions' -H  'Accept: application/json' -H  'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"action_type":"InstanceStart"}'
HTTP/1.1 204
Server: Firecracker API
Connection: keep-alive
```

Go back to the first terminal, you will see login prompt. Enter `root` as username and `root` as password. 

And Viola!

```s
Welcome to Alpine Linux 3.10
Kernel 4.4 on an x86_64 (ttyS0)

localhost login: root
Password:
Welcome to Alpine!

The Alpine Wiki contains a large amount of how-to guides and general
information about administrating Alpine systems.
See <http://wiki.alpinelinux.org>.

You can setup the system with the command: setup-alpine

You may change this message by editing /etc/motd.

login[858]: root login on 'ttyS0'
localhost:~#
```

In the next article, we will continue integrating Firecracker and Kata Container. 

<i>Stay tuned!</i>
